I am a graduate student at Johns Hopkins. I am interested in the computational challenges associated with Bayesian statistics, which I focus on in this blog. While I enjoy working with many types of data, my passion is working with genomic, clinical, and healthcare data.

Before Hopkins, I studied Mathematics at Virginia Tech. After undergrad, I worked as a data analyst at Deloitte in the federal consulting space. Following Deloitte, I took a position at Marriott in their digital analytics team. Here I worked on statistical models that included sort order algorithms and natural language processing of review data.
